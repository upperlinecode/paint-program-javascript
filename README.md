# Group Project: Paint Program

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/upperlinecode/paint-program-javascript)](https://repl.it/github/upperlinecode/paint-program-javascript)

## The Goal

Today, we're going to build a paint program using p5. You've probably used some kind of paint program before, but they usually consist of a large canvas with some tools or colors to let the user create art. The splatter paint program we built previously is an example of simple paint program; today, you'll be making a similar project of your designing.

## Brainstorming

Before we jump in, we need to have a pretty good idea about what the paint program could eventually become. There are so many different ways this could go:

* You could build a program that let's your user switch between lots of different pretty colors
* You could give your user various brush shapes and sizes to choose from
* You could introduce completely novel tools like a stamp that draws bunnies wherever you click

Before you start coding out your paint program, take some time to let your imagination get ahold of this project. What types of tools and painters are there? What would be helpful to you in creating a masterpiece?

## MVP - Minimum Viable Product

The highest level version of what this paint program can be is pretty impressive, but an important part of this process is designing what we call an MVP - a minimum viable product.

A Minimum Viable Product has only the core features necessary to make it useful to a user.

You see evidence of this design mindset almost every time you start up your phone - most of the apps you have get updated a few times every couple of months - that's because great programs are never TRULY finished, so no company can afford to wait until an app is perfect to release it. Instead, great design teams think in terms of features. They make a short-term, manageable goal that will get them one step closer to their larger goal.

Here's a great cartoon that illustrates this design process:

The cartoon uses the analogy of building a car, and as designers, we are tempted to try to build the perfect wheel before we move on to the next step of a car. The trouble with that design strategy is that you won't be able to test anything or use any part of the program until the whole thing is finished. This is a _frustrating_ process because you spend most of your time building something that you're not even sure if you _can_ build.

Instead, the second design strategy involves building the simplest version of something that works in the same way the car ultimately will. Sure, it's not a full fledged car, but you can start testing it and learning how to make it better so much sooner - it may not be perfect, but it already works! From here your users can test it out and give you feedback on how to make it better. This design process is so _satisfying_ because it works right away; you'll experience success over and over again when you use this strategy.

### Our MVP

There are lots of ways this project can go, but your MVP should be the bare minimum to feel like you have a functional program.

We know it feels small, but this should probably mean something along the lines of "The program draws a circle wherever the mouse goes, so long as it's pressed." Once you have this basic function, you can explore colors and shapes and whatever else you please.
